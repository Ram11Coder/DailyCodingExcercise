/**
 * Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4
arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: YES
Explaination: 
The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
arr = {1, 3, 5}
Output: NO
Explaination: This array can never be 
partitioned into two such parts.
