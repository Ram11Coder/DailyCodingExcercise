/**
 * Batman, Spiderman and Superman are going to start a business. The total investment is 1000M$. Anyone can add new investment to their existing investment. They can transfer investments between themselves. The program should be in OOP style and should have a menu for user to do all operations. (Something similar to below example.)
Constraints:
    a.Total investment should always be 
      equal to or lesser than 1000M$.
    b.Spiderman's investment should never
      exceed Batman's.
    c.Investment cannot go into negative.
    d.Display investments on each update.
Example:
    Input: batman = 300, spiderman = 250,
          superman = 100
    Output:
    batman - 300
    spiderman - 250
    superman - 100
    add 100 into spiderman
    sorry, spiderman cant have more 
    investment than batman add 200 
    to batman
    batman - 500
    spiderman - 250
    superman - 100
    add 500 to superman
    sorry, total investment cant 
    exceed 1000.
