 * Remove the duplicates in the String. 
Testcase 1:
Input: Java1234
Output: Javb1234 (Remove the second ‘a’ as it is duplicated)
Testcase 2:
Input: Python1223:
Output: Python1234 (Replace the second 2 with 3, and replace 3 with 4 as 3 is replaced for the duplicated 2)
Testcase 3:
Input: aBuzZ9900
Output: aBuzC9012
(Replace the second ‘Z’ with ‘C’ as ‘a’ and ‘B’ are already there in the String. Replace with capital C as the letter to be replaced is capital Z. The second 9 turns out to be zero and the zero turns out to ‘1’ and the second zero turns out to ‘2’)
